# Guidelines

This is a guideline for putting values in the block properties.

## Drills
### Common
- Requirements just multiply the item cost (previous version) to **2**.
- Requirement the main item should be the same value as the **highest value + half of the highest value.**
- Research Cost just multiply the requirement cost to 10.
- Liquid Boost Intensity base value is **1.5** just add **0.25** to the previous version value.

### Mini
- Just divide all to 2.
- Liquid Boost Intensity should **remain the same** if it is **Fortify**.
- Liquid Boost Intensity should **add 0.25** if it is **Enhanced**.

### Fortify

- Health base value is **320** multiply it to the **version number** of the drill.
- Armor base value is **75** multiply it to the **version number + 1** of the drill.
- Item Capacity base value is **50** just add **25** to the previous version value.
- Consume Liquid Amount base value is **1** just add **0.25** to the previous version value.

### Enhanced

- Health base value is **320** multiply it to the **version number** of the drill.
- Armor base value is **75** multiply it to the **version number - 1** of the drill.
- Item Capacity base value is **50** just add **50** to the previous version value.
- Liquid Capacity base value is **25** just add **10** to the previous version value.
- Consume Liquid Amount base value is **1** just add **0.5** to the previous version value.

### BASE VALUE for CRAFTING
    copper/10 * no. of tiles * version no.
    lead/10 * no. of tiles * version no.
    graphite/20 * no. of tiles * version no.
    silicon/30 * no. of tiles * version no.
    titanium/30 * no. of tiles * version no.
    plastanium/50 * no. of tiles * version no.
    thorium/40 * no. of tiles * version no.
    phase-fabric/50 * no. of tiles * version no.
    beryllium/30 * no. of tiles * version no.
    surge-alloy/80 * no. of tiles * version no.
    tungsten/50 * no. of tiles * version no.
    carbide/70 * no. of tiles * version no.
