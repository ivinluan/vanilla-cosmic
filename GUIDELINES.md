## Drills
### Common
- Requirements just **multiply** the item cost to **2**.
- Requirement the main item should be the **same value** as the highest item.
- Research Cost just **multiply** the item cost to **10**.

### Mini
- Just divide all to **2**.
- Liquid Boost Intensity should **remain the same** if it is **Fortify**.
- Liquid Boost Intensity should **add 0.25** if it is **Enhanced**.

### Fortify

- Health base value is **320** multiply it to the **version number** of the drill.
- Armor base value is **75** multiply it to the **version number + 1** of the drill.

### Enhanced

- Health base value is **320** multiply it to the **version number** of the drill.
- Armor base value is **75** multiply it to the **version number - 1** of the drill.
- Item Capacity base value is **50** just add **25**.
- Liquid Capacity base value is **25** just add **10**.
- Liquid Boost Intensity base value is **1.5** just add **0.25**.
